== Test Expert

There are two test expert advisors:

* one for the the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq:
[[MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTZmqCmdEA.mq4|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTZmqCmdEA.mq4]]
We are having **big** problems with the receiving of messages by Mt4 with the compiled
DLL: the messages get received, but shortly afterwards, Mt4 crashes.
We are having **big** problems with the receiving of messages from Mt4 with the
compiled DLL: the messages are sometimes totally corrupt, with nulls in strings.
We are often having problems with the first 16 bytes of a message published from Mt4
that are sometimes (not always) garbled, including nulls. The rest of the message
is fine. See:
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1 and [[CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq]].
**In summary, the compiled DLL OTMql4Zmq is unusable for now**.

* one for the Python [[PyZmq]]:
[[MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestZmqEA.mq4|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestZmqEA.mq4]]
See [[PythonOTMql4Zmq]].

=== Troubleshooting

During debugging, we have had cases of the expert not being able
to be removed: this is not normally the case, only when we have bad code.

If this happens, it may precent Mt4 from exiting cleanly.  If so, you
must kill Mt4, and then manually edit the profile for that chart to
remove the expert. Go to the {{{profile}} directory of your Mt4
installation and read the file {{{lastprofile.ini}}} to find out what
profile you are currently using. Then go into that directory and
search the {{{chr}}} files for the ones that contain an {{{<expert>}}}
section. Remove the section that starts with {{{<expert>}}} and ends with
{{{</expert>}}}, inclusive.  Then restart Mt4.

OTMql4Zmq - MQL4 bindings for ZeroMQ, the high-speed messaging protocol
for asynchronous communications between financial and trading applications.

https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/

With ZeroMQ http://zeromq.org/ you can:
* Connect your code in any language, on any platform.
* Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, TIPC, multicast.
* Smart patterns like pub-sub, push-pull, and router-dealer.
* High-speed asynchronous I/O engines, in a tiny library.
* Backed by a large and active open source community.
* Supports every modern language and platform.
* Build any architecture: centralized, distributed, small, or large.

There are now two ways of using ZeroMq via in this package:

1. Directly using compiled DLL. We were having problems with the compiled DLL,
   but these are now fixed, as we have dropped back to ZeroMQ v2.2.0.  See
   [[CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq]].
   
2. Through [[PyZmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq]]
   in Python under Metatrader using 
   [[OTMql4Py|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py]].
   OTMql4Zmq is working fine in both directions.

You may also want to look at our RabbitMQ solution,
which is a pure Python solution using OTMql4Py and also works without issues:

You may want to also look at:
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader
which provides a command-line interpreter to speak to the OTMql4AMQP
enabled Metatrader.

=== Pre-Release

**This is a work in progress - a developers' pre-release version.**

OTMql4Zmq works with Metatrader on builds > 6xx, but the test suite and documentation
still need writing, as well as testing on different versions of
Windows and Mt4.

ZeroMQ 4.x is not yet supported. The source code for the Compiled DLL has been moved to
https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/
to better document the changes we made in it from the original source.
As a convenience, we have checked in the binaries from that project
to the {{{src/mql4zmq}}} directory. In theory the files in this project
will always mirror that project, but that project is always master.

[[mql4zmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq]] is being compiled against a v2.2.0
release of [[ZeroMQ|http://zeromq.org]]. If anyone is good at MSVC and ZeroMQ,
if you could look at the code in that project and help us with ZeroMQ 4.x
version improvements, we'd be grateful. In general, you can use any version of
ZeroMQ later than v2.2.0 to communicate with the
[[mql4zmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq]] libraries, so for example you can
use the latest [[PyZmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq]] for
client scripts: see [[Scripts|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/Scripts]].

The project wiki should be open for editing by anyone logged into GitHub:
**Please report any system it works or doesn't work on in the wiki:
include the Metatrader build number, the origin of the metatrader exe,
the Windows version, and the ZeroMq version and version of the Python pyzmq.**
This code in known to run under Linux Wine (1.7.x), so this project
bridges Metatrader to ZeroMq under Linux.

=== Installation

For the moment there is no installer: just "git clone" or download the
zip from github.com and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy
the folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation. It will
not overwrite any system files, and keeps its files in subdirectories
called {{{OTMql4}}}.

See [[PyZmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq]]
for instructions for installing into your Python; you wil need this either
to run th

Use the Wiki to start topics for discussion:
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/Home
It's good to use the wiki for knowledge capture, and then we can pull
the important pages back into the documentation in the share/doc directory.
You may need to be signed into github.com to see or edit in the wiki.

OTMql4Zmq - MQL4 bindings for ZeroMQ, the high-speed messaging protocol
for asynchronous communications between financial and trading applications.

https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/

With ZeroMQ http://zeromq.org/ you can:
* Connect your code in any language, on any platform.
* Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, TIPC, multicast.
* Smart patterns like pub-sub, push-pull, and router-dealer.
* High-speed asynchronous I/O engines, in a tiny library.
* Backed by a large and active open source community.
* Supports every modern language and platform.
* Build any architecture: centralized, distributed, small, or large.

There are now two ways of using ZeroMq via in this package:

1. Directly using compiled DLL. We are having problems with the compiled DLL,
   where messages are being sent by Mt4 work but it's not receiving them.
   See
   [[CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/CompiledDllOTMql4Zmq]].
   
2. Through [[PyZmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq]]
   in Python under Metatrader using 
   [[OTMql4Py|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py]].
   OTMql4Zmq is working fine in both directions.

You may also want to look at our RabbitMQ solution,
which is a pure Python solution using OTMql4Py and also works without issues:

You may want to also look at:
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader
which provides a command-line interpreter to speak to the OTMql4AMQP
enabled Metatrader.

=== Pre-Release

**This is a work in progress - a developers' pre-release version.**

OTMql4Zmq works with Metatrader on builds > 6xx, but the test suite and documentation
still need writing, as well as testing on different versions of
Windows and Mt4.

ZeroMQ 4.x is now partitally supported. It's being compiled against a v4.0.4
release of [[ZeroMQ|http://zeromq.org]], but only part of the API changes are
in the {{{src/mql4zmq/mql4zmq.[ch]}}}. If anyone is good at MSVC and ZeroMQ,
if you could look at the code in that directory and check for version improvements,
we'd be grateful.

The project wiki should be open for editing by anyone logged into GitHub:
**Please report any system it works or doesn't work on in the wiki:
include the Metatrader build number, the origin of the metatrader exe,
the Windows version, and the ZeroMq version and version of the Python pyzmq.**
This code in known to run under Linux Wine (1.7.x), so this project
bridges Metatrader to ZeroMq under Linux.

=== Installation

For the moment there is no installer: just "git clone" or download the
zip from github.com and unzip into an empty directory. Then recursively copy
the folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation. It will
not overwrite any system files, and keeps its files in subdirectories
called {{{OTMql4}}}.

See [[PyZmq|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/PyZmq]]
for instructions for installing into your Python.

Use the Wiki to start topics for discussion:
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/wiki/Home
It's good to use the wiki for knowledge capture, and then we can pull
the important pages back into the documentation in the share/doc directory.

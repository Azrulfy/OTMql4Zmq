### Test Expert

There is a test expert advisor for PyZmq in
`Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestZmqEA.mq4`

During debugging, we have had cases of the expert not being able
to be removed: this is not normally the case, only when we have bad code.
If this happens, it may precent Mt4 from exiting cleanly.
If so, you must kill Mt4, and then manually edit the profile for that chart
to remove the expert. Go to the `profile` directory of your Mt4 installation
and read the file `lastprofile.ini` to find out what profile you are
currently using. Then go into that directory and search the `chr` files
for the ones that contain an `<expert>` section. Remove the section
that starts with `<expert>` and ends with `</expert>`, inclusive.
Then restart Mt4.

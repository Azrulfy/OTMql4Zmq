## PyZmq

PyZMQ is the official Python binding for the ZeroMQ Messaging Library
and can be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq 
The project's Home Page is at http://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq

It can be used to run a subscriber or publisher from outside of
Metatrader, to receive or send information. For example, look at
`OTZmqSubscribe.py` and `OTZmqPublish.py` in the `bin` directory.

We have used the latest version at the time of writing, but we expect
that any version will work.

### Installation

If you are running the Python(x,y) distribution, then `pyzmq` is
already included.

If you have `pip` installed in your Python and are connected to the
Internet, you can simply run `pip pyzmq`.

Otherwise, download the Python egg:
https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/p/pyzmq/pyzmq-14.5.0-py2.7-win32.egg
and place it as-is in your Python's site-packages directory:

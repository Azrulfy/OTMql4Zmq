## PyZmq

PyZMQ is the official Python binding for the ZeroMQ Messaging Library
and can be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzmq 
The project's Home Page is at http://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq

It can be used to run a subscriber or publisher from outside of
Metatrader, to receive or send information. It requires
the OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge
https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/

For example of using `pyzmq` instead of the compiled DLL, see
`MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestZmqEA.mq4`

### Installation

You will need to have `pyzmq` installed in your Python.  We have used
the latest version at the time of writing, but we expect that any
version will work. If you are running the Python(x,y) distribution,
then `pyzmq` is already included.

If not, and you have `pip` installed in your Python and are connected to the
Internet, you can simply run `pip pyzmq`.

Otherwise, download the Python egg:
https://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/p/pyzmq/pyzmq-14.5.0-py2.7-win32.egg
and `easy_install` it into your Python's site-packages directory.

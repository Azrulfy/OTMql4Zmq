## OTMql4Zmq Notes

### Changes

The source checked in to the `src/` directory is from:
`git clone -b MQ_610_ZMQ_4 --single-branch https://github.com/ungratefulson/mql4zmq`

This has the very simple changes needed to run against ZeroMQ 4.0.x.
We deleted the `.mqh` file, as that was not updated for Build 600,
and is replaced with our version in the `MQL4/Include/OTMql4` directory.

We also deleted the `examples/` directory as we will have new Python
scripts in `bin/` and those examples do not use our nomenclature.

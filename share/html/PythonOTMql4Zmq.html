<h3>Python OTMql4Zmq</h3>

<p>The PyZmq expert and code requires the OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/</a><br />
with <tt>pyzmq</tt> installed in it (see <a href="PyZmq.html">PyZmq</a>).</p>

<p>The Metatrader-Python bridge also requires the OpenTrading  Library:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/</a></p>

<p>For an example expert for using the Python OTMql4Zmq, see <a href="TestExpert.html">TestExpert</a>.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>We are having problems with the receiving of messages with the Python <a href="PyZmq.html">PyZmq</a>:<br />
the first 16 bytes of a message published from OTMql4Zmq are sometimes (not always)<br />
garbled, including nulls. The rest of the message is fine.<br />
The workaround it to pad the message with 16 bytes. See:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/issues/1</a></p></body>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>In general, recusively copy everything in the <tt>MQL4</tt> directory<br />
to your <tt>c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4</tt> directory.</p>

<p>This is the same as making the following 3 directories if they don't aleady exist:</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4\Experts\OTMql4</tt></li>
	<li><tt>c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4\Include\OTMql4</tt></li>
	<li><tt>c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4\Libraries\OTMql4</tt>and then copying:</li>
</ul><pre>
MQL4\Include\OTMql4\*.mqh
=&gt; c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4\Include\OTMql4

MQL4\Libraries\OTMql4\*.mqh
=&gt; c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4\Libraries\OTMql4

MQL4\Experts\OTMql4\*.mq4 
=&gt; c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4\Experts\OTMql4
</pre>

<p>This will help make this project compatible with other OpenTrader<br />
projects, and will simplify the release-packaging later. Also by<br />
giving files different names from Austen Conrad, we help avoid<br />
collisions in case someone has both projects.</p>

<p>Then copy the DLL files to the right places:</p>
<pre>
src\mql4zmq\pre-compiled\mql4zmq.dll
=&gt; c:\Program Files\[metatrader directory]\MQL4\Libraries\OTMql4\mql4zmq.dll

src\mql4zmq\pre-compiled\libzmq.dll
=&gt; c:\Windows\SysWOW64\libzmq.dll or
=&gt; c:\Windows\System32\libzmq.dll or
whatever the windows system library is for your version of Windows.
</pre>

<p>These dlls and the header file <tt>MQL4/Include/OTMql4/OTMql4Zmq.mqh</tt><br />
are maintained in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/mql4zmq/</a> project.<br />
These to projects should always be in sync, but if there is ever a<br />
difference, use the files that are in this project and report bugs<br />
against them here. We'll push the changes upstream to that project,<br />
and that project may be "broken" as it tries to upgrade to ZeroMQ 4.x.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>This project requires the prior installation of our<br />
MQL4 trading library: <a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib.">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib.</a><br />
Again, <tt>git clone</tt> this from <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and recursively copy<br />
it's folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation.</p>

<p>To use the Python version of OTMql4Zmq, or to use the testing <a href="Scripts.html">Scripts</a><br />
in the <tt>bin</tt> directory with either version, this project requires<br />
the prior installation of our OTMql4Py project:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py.">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py.</a><br />
Again, <tt>git clone</tt> this from <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and recursively copy<br />
it's folder MQL4 over the MQL4 folder of your Metatrader installation.</p>

<p>One day we'll make an installer, but for now, you must install the three<br />
projects manually, and if you update the code via <tt>git pull</tt>, be<br />
sure to update all three, as they are usually checked in together.</p></body>
